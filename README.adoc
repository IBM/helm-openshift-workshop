=== About this workskhop
This repository contains the work related to Helm3 Openshift workshop.
As this workshop, the shared experience of travel brings people together. As a visitor you have the opportunity to see different landmarks; in this workshop a  microservice containing landmarks informations will be deployed via Helm Charts and will have its data persisted in a database (also managed with Helm Charts). The visitor microservice will get the informations about a landmark at a certain address via an API endpoint exposed by the deployed landmark microservice.

Throughout this workshop you will improve your knowledge on deploying Java based applications using three Helm charts techniques (click on each URL below to reach each of them):

* {home}/landmark[chart per service approach]
* {home}/landmark/tree/feature/leader-chart-lab[leader chart approach]
* {home}/visitor[hybrid chart approach]
* <<bonus.adoc#, Bonus: Using Helm Operators for Stateful Services>>

At the end of this workshop you should be able to understand and use Helm on an OpenShift v4.4+ edition. 
Happy travelling through each of the sections!

'''
=== Prerequisites
For this workshop code-ready containers will be used, which create a local single-VM Openshift 4 cluster on your laptop.

Other pre-requirements that must be met in your system are:

* https://git-scm.com/downloads[git]
* https://docs.docker.com/install/[docker version 17.03+]
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl] version v1.11.3+ (or oc client).
* https://golang.org/dl/[go] version v1.12+. (Optional if you aren’t installing from source)

=== OpenShift Origin v4 setup

In order to get started with OpenShift v4.x https://github.com/code-ready/crc[Code Ready Containers] will be used.
You can download https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers[CodeReady Containers] from the product page.

Please open any of the below links, depending on your OS to setup the downloaded Code Ready Containers:

* https://developers.redhat.com/openshift/local-openshift-windows/[Windows]
* https://developers.redhat.com/openshift/local-openshift-macos/[MacOS]

=== Helm setup

Helm is a packager for Kubernetes that bundles related manifest files and packages them into a single logical deployment unit: *Chart*.
Simplified, for many engineers Helm makes it *easy* to start using Kubernetes with *real* applications.
Helm Charts are useful for addressing the installation complexities and simple upgrades of particularly stateless applications like web apps.
Say goodbye to the many, long, hard-coded yaml files and embrace an easier way to manage your deployed applications!

In v3, Helm is used entirely through the helm CLI.
The Helm CLI is a utility usually run interactively outside of the cluster.

Users find a chart for the desired software, parameterize its resources through Helm to deploy Kubernetes artifacts and this eventually brings up said software.

Before diving into installing Helm, make sure you have installed Go, version 1.12 or higher.
The bellow links describe how to install Helm on different platforms using the CLI:

** https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/cli_reference/helm_cli/getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift-container-platform.html#on-windows-10[On Windows 10]
** https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/cli_reference/helm_cli/getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift-container-platform.html#on-macos[On MacOS]

Always validate your helm installation by running:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ helm version
----

=== Check your environment readiness
Start your crc environment if it’s not already up.

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]

INFO To access the cluster, first set up your environment by following ‘crc oc-env’ instructions
INFO Then you can access it by running ‘oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443'
INFO To login as an admin, username is ‘kubeadmin’ and password is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
